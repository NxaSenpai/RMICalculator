# Distributed Calculator (JavaScript Version)

This project is a simple **distributed-style calculator UI** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates client‑side computation with a clean, dark, modern interface, includes a **snowfall animation**, and allows users to resize the **history panel** on the right side.

The calculator supports multiple operations such as:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Power
* Modulo

## ▶️ How to Run

Just run by using this command in your terminal

```
node server.js
```

Then open the link it prints (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## 🧪 How It Works

* JavaScript reads the two numbers and selected operator.
* The result is calculated on the client side.
* The result is displayed instantly.
* A history entry is added automatically to the right panel.
* Snow is rendered on a `<canvas>` using basic 2D animation.
